  *In order to write any Dart Program,be it a script or a Flutter app,you must define a function called main.

  ! This function tells Dart where the program starts and it must be in the file that is considered the "entry point" for your program

  ? The main function will execute any code within it's code block that you'd like it to

  * You must have exactly one main function in your program
  
  ! In general ,your main function will likely initiate any pre-processing needed for your program, and end with a function call that runs the rest of your app.

  * Print is used for printing to the console ,useful for debugging purpose.
